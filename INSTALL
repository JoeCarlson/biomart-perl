###############  Installing & Configuring MartView  #############
-----------------------------------------------------------------
To configure the installation, check out the 'biomart-web' folder
and from the root of biomart-web directory, run:

[your biomart-web directory]$ perl ./bin/configure.pl

Follow the interactive process and you are done.

This would use the defaultMartRegistry.xml from directory biomart-web/conf/

If you wish to you use a different registry file, simply place the registry 
file in directory 
[your biomart-web directory]/conf/yourMartRegistry.xml
and run:
[your biomart-web directory]$ perl ./bin/configure.pl -r yourMartRegistry.xml

#####################  Run Apache ###############################
Once you are done, simple run your standalone apache instance as
e.g 
for APACHE 1.3 [path to Apache]/bin/httpd -d $PWD
for APACHE 2.x [path to Apache]/sbin/httpd -d $PWD

where $PWD should be your 'biomart-web' directory

Then point your browser to http://localhost:8080/cgi-bin/martview

-----------------------------------------------------------------
#########################  Advanced Options  #####################
-----------------------------------------------------------------
At some point, you may wish to use the following optional switches 
as you configure.

[your biomart-web directory]$ perl bin/configure.pl [ACTION optional] [MODE optional] [REGISTRYFILE]

REGISTRYFILE: -r registryFile.xml
-r 	path/name of registry file. should live in conf directory. if no registry is specified,
	conf/defaultMartRegistry.xml will be used

ACTION: --clean, --cached, --update
--clean
	Removes all existing xmls from the local disk being used, and fetch 
	all of them again from target MartLocations as per martRegistryFile.xml
--cached (default)
	Checks if there is already a pre-configured registry object associated
	with this registry file. If there exists one pre-configured registry, 
	simply retruns that, and doesnt redo all the configuration 	process. 
	The process is simply based on the name of registry file. Incase you 
	have chaged the contents of registry file, try either  --clean or 
	--update, which ever suits you.
--update
	Updates the registry object, incase the xml files representing your
	datasets have been updated. Can also be used to switch between MODES
	[--memory and --lazyload]
--recompile
	Recompiles templates for all visible datasets and default templates.
	This switch is related to inhouse development only. If you fancy changing 
	master templates knowing what you are doing in order to fiddle with cosmetics
	of Martview - most welcome.

MODE: --memory, --lazyload
--memory (default)
	Recommended for user with healthy amount of memory available.
--lazyload
	If you want your installation\/configuration process and Apache to utilise 
	minimum possible memory, try this option. Keeps all the information on disk and 
	brings only the required amount of information to memory as and when needed.

OPTIONAL:
--help
	list all of the above switches on user's terminal.



Examples:
[your biomart-web directory]$ perl ./bin/configure.pl --update --lazylaod -r yourMartRegistry.xml
[your biomart-web directory]$ perl ./bin/configure.pl --update --memory -r yourMartRegistry.xml

In the following case, defaultMartRegistry.xml will be used.
[your biomart-web directory]$ perl ./bin/configure.pl --clean --lazyload

Following two statements are equivalent:
[your biomart-web directory]$ perl ./bin/configure.pl --clean --memory -r defaultMartRegistry.xml
[your biomart-web directory]$ perl ./bin/configure.pl --clean

Following two statements are equivalent:
[your biomart-web directory]$ perl ./bin/configure.pl --cached --lazyload -r yourMartRegistry.xml
[your biomart-web directory]$ perl ./bin/configure.pl --lazyload -r yourMartRegistry.xml
