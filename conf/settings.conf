# These settings are used to control how the background
# results jobs are managed. 
#
# Set resultsDirCount to the number of results directories
# you want to use. Then, use resultsDir1, resultsDir2 etc.
# to assign names for these directories, up to resultsDirN
# where N is the value of resultsDirCount. Background jobs
# will be assigned to each of these resultsDir locations
# by a hash function which is intended to distribute them
# evenly.
#
# Use resultsDir to specify where
# files containing results from background jobs are stored.
# This folder must (a) exist and (b) be writable by the
# owner of the web server process.
#
# The enable setting should have a value of 'yes'
# if you want background jobs to be available to the user.
# Any other value, including non-lowercase versions of 'yes'
# will turn background jobs off.

# Mail settings are used for informing users when their
# background tasks are finished. The mailerType defines 
# the way in which mail is sent, as understood by 
# Mail::Mailer. For details of how to control this, see:

#
# The from address is the address that messages will 
# appear to be from.

# a database table must already exist with any name but with strict columnName/Types
# EXAMPLES
# ========== MySQL ============
# first create the table as
# CREATE TABLE sessions ( id CHAR(32) NOT NULL UNIQUE, a_session LONGTEXT NOT NULL ) ;
# then the following settings should follow under [sessions]
